# An ABM Model of Social Spiders

## What is this thing?

This is a model of a colony of _Anelosimus studiosus_ spiders, based primarily on the various assumptions and findings of two different papers: _"Site-specific group selection drives locally adapted group compositions"_ by Goodnight & Pruitt (2014), and _"Animal personality aligns task specialization and task proficiency in a spider society"_ by Wright, Holbrook, & Pruitt (2014). A major hypothesis of this model is that it is the influence of personality on a spider's task preference and performance that, in aggregate, lead to the survival of and adaption towards certain ratios of aggressive:docile spiders in spider colonies. 

To that end, the model is built and designed with these primary goals in mind:

* Have individual spiders perform, based on personality (aggressive vs. docile), tasks at frequency and proficiency similar to the findings of Wright, Holbrook, and Pruitt (2014).

* Survive, thrive, die out, and adapt based on initial starting conditions and aggressive:docile spider ratios, similar with the results for experimental native spider mixtures in Goodnight and Pruitt (2014).

Plus the addition of some secondary goals:

* Explore the consequences of using different methods for assigning aggressiveness (or docility) to spiders (ex. How close to life is a simulated colony using a bimodal distribution vs. a flat distribution of aggression?) 

* Be just generally fun and educational to watch and play around with.

Further information can be found in the info tab of the model or in the project paper (found under docs). Keep in mind that the project paper will obsolete as changes to the model are made.

## What was it built with/How do I run it?

This model was built in [NetLogo 6.0.4](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), and you'll need that or a later version to open, modify, and run it.
